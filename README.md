# Wallpaper Theme Sync XP

## Description

Wallpaper Theme Sync XP is a simple software designed to apply color schemes from the Luna Xpander theme based on your desktop wallpaper. Built specifically for Windows XP, this tool mimics Windows 10's automatic color feature, albeit in a primitive way.

This program works especially well with John’s Background Switcher, making it useful for automatically adjusting theme colors when cycling through a wallpaper slideshow.

P.S. This is very basic software, and I plan to improve it through future updates.

Here are links for the required theme and software:

## Demo

## Features

- Detects the dominant color from your desktop wallpaper.

- Matches the detected color to the closest Luna Xpander substyle.

- Automatically updates the Windows XP theme color via registry adjustments.

- Restarts necessary services and Explorer to apply changes.

## How It Works

The program captures a screenshot of your desktop, extracts the most prominent color, and maps it to a predefined list of Luna Xpander color options. It then updates the corresponding registry values and restarts relevant components to apply the new color.

## Installation

- Ensure .NET Framework 3.5 is installed on your machine.

- Download the executable file.

- Run the program as an administrator.

## Usage

- Launch the program.

- No need to manually minimize windows — the program handles this step for you.

- Let the program capture and analyze the screen.

- The system theme updates, and Explorer restarts.

## Requirements

- John's Background Switcher for Windows XP (I’m using ver 4.7, which is supported by Windows XP)

- Luna Xpander Theme

- Windows XP (32-bit or 64-bit)

- .NET Framework 3.5

This software is experimental and may not work perfectly on all setups. While working sometimes the active desktop recovery screen appears, so this software is not perfect. You might encounter some other errors too
